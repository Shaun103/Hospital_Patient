This is final assignement I 
submitted for my Advanced C++ class 
The project simulates the information 
collected from a patient that a hospital 
would collect. The program creates a patient object
that will hold all user generated information 
such as id, age, name and illness description
Once the object is created, the user has 
the option to: search by patient ID, display
all patients in the vector, remove a 
patient, update a specific patient and 
print all patients within the vector to a file
